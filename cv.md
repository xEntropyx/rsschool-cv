## Summary
I started my journey in IT in 2022 by joining to a manual software testing course, where I acquired range of knowledge contained in ISTQB Foundation
Level syllabus. I spent my time on learning fundementals of HTML and CSS, SOAP and REST testing tools, as well as on various testing methods. For some time now I have been working as Junior QA at Cheil, which allows me to use my basic knowledge in the above-mentioned set of skills. I have always been interested in issues related to technology, and solving computer problems on my own has always given me great satisfaction. As time flies and today's companies require even more technical abilities, I would love to devote my time to get more knowledge and even greater fulfilment from exploring the IT world. I'm sure that JavaScript will open a range of opportunities for us. :cowboy_hat_face:
